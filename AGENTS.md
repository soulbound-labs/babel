# Babel — orientation for agents

> Canonical **root** agent-context. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file so Claude Code
> and cross-tool agents read one source. Read this first, then open the doctrine for the
> area you're working in.

A substrate-governed repository.

## Verification gates — declared, never assumed

This repo declares its build/test/lint gate in `substrate.yaml` (`gate: {compile, test, lint}`).
`/substrate:execute` reads and runs those; it does not guess a toolchain. If `substrate.yaml`
or its `gate` block is missing, execution aborts with an explanation — fix the file, don't probe.

## Spec & task lifecycle — ALL planning docs live under `docs/tasks/`

One home for every planning artifact — feature specs, plan docs, research briefs, spike records:
**`docs/tasks/ongoing/<slug>/` while the work is active → `git mv` the whole folder to
`docs/tasks/completed/<slug>/` when its tracking bead/epic closes.** No other location. tbd does
**not** move these files — it tracks beads in `.tbd/`, never your spec files; the move is a
deliberate manual step.

## Doctrine — the binding architecture

Every change is bound to the doctrines registered in `docs/doctrine/doctrine-manifest.yaml`
(enforced by `docs/scripts/doctrine-lint.sh`). Read before touching the matching area:

- `docs/doctrine/agents-doctrine.md` — **the doctrine on doctrines** (the meta-doctrine): authoring
  rules, the manifest as single source of truth, the two enforcement gates, and the drift-evaluation
  protocol. Read before adding/renaming any doctrine.
- `docs/doctrine/agents-parallel-execution-doctrine.md` — parallel-bead orchestration (single-writer
  tracker, integration branch + merge-on-green, file-disjoint waves, gate-before-close, two-stage
  gate, worktree hygiene). Read before running a bead DAG with subagents.
- `docs/doctrine/tooling-doctrine.md` — the no-JS toolchain: TypeScript everywhere, scripts run via
  `tsx` (never `node`), TS build/ESLint config (via `jiti`), bash reserved for the zero-dep kernel,
  and the gate declared in `substrate.yaml`. Read before adding a script, config, or dependency.

Add your own stack/domain doctrines with `/substrate:add-doctrine`; each self-registers in the manifest.

title: tbd Workflow
description: Full tbd workflow guide for agents
---

**`tbd` helps humans and agents ship code with greater speed, quality, and discipline.**

1. **Beads**: Git-native issue tracking (tasks, bugs, features).
   Never lose work across sessions.
   Drop-in replacement for `bd`.
2. **Spec-Driven Workflows**: Plan features → break into beads → implement
   systematically.
3. **Knowledge Injection**: engineering guidelines (TypeScript, Python, TDD,
   testing, and more) available on demand.
4. **Shortcuts**: Reusable instruction templates for common workflows (code review,
   commits, PRs, cleanup, handoffs).

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g get-tbd@latest
tbd setup --auto --prefix=<name>   # Fresh project (--prefix is REQUIRED: 2-8 alphabetic chars recommended. ALWAYS ASK THE USER FOR THE PREFIX; do not guess it)
tbd setup --auto                   # Existing tbd project (prefix already set)
tbd setup --from-beads             # Migration from .beads/ if `bd` has been used
```

## Routine Commands

```bash
tbd --help    # Command reference
tbd status    # Status
tbd doctor    # If there are problems

tbd setup --auto   # Run any time to refresh setup
tbd prime      # Restore full context on tbd after compaction
```

## CRITICAL: You Operate tbd — The User Doesn't

**You are the tbd operator:** Users talk naturally; you translate their requests to tbd
actions. DO NOT tell users to run tbd commands.
That's your job.

- **WRONG**: "Run `tbd create` to track this bug"

- **RIGHT**: _(you run `tbd create` yourself and tell the user it's tracked)_

**Welcoming a user:** When users ask "what is tbd?"
or want help → run `tbd shortcut welcome-user`

## User Request → Agent Action

| User Says                                 | You (the Agent) Run                                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Issues/Beads**                          |                                                          |

| _(your choice whenever appropriate)_      | `tbd list`, `tbd dep add`, `tbd close`, `tbd sync`, etc. |

**Note:** Never gitignore `.tbd/workspaces/` — the outbox must be committed to your
working branch. See `tbd guidelines tbd-sync-troubleshooting` for details.

## CRITICAL: Session Closing Protocol

**Before saying "done", you MUST complete this checklist:**

```
[ ] 1. git add + git commit
[ ] 2. git push
[ ] 3. gh pr checks <PR> --watch 2>&1 (IMPORTANT: WAIT for final summary, do NOT tell user it is done until you confirm it passes CI!)
[ ] 4. tbd close/update <id> for all beads worked on
[ ] 5. tbd sync
[ ] 6. CONFIRM CI passed (if failed: fix, run tests, re-push, restart from step 3)
```

**Work is not done until pushed, CI passes, and tbd is synced.**

## Bead Tracking Rules

- Track all task work not done immediately as beads (discovered work, TODOs,
  multi-session work)
- When in doubt, create a bead
- Check `tbd ready` when not given specific directions
- Always close/update beads and run `tbd sync` at session end

- **Status**: open, in_progress, closed
- **JSON output**: Add `--json` to any command

The full shortcut + guideline directory is generated per-project by `tbd setup --auto`.

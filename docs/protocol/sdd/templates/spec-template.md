## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Objective

<What this feature accomplishes>

### 1.2 Constraints

- MUST: <inherited from brief>
- MUST NOT: <inherited from brief>

### 1.3 Success Criteria

- <Binary pass/fail criterion>

---

## 2. Scope

| In Scope | Out of Scope |
|----------|--------------|
| <Feature X> | <Feature Y> |

---

## 3. Architecture / Data Model

<Schema definitions, relationships, diagrams>

---

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 Domain Layer

<Entities, factories, pure functions>

### 4.2 Backend Layer (Convex)

<Schema changes with `v.*` validators + indexes, queries/mutations/actions, `requireAuth` behavior, domain functions called for validation. See `docs/doctrine/backend-doctrine.md`.>

### 4.3 Frontend Layer

<Routes (TanStack Router), hooks (Convex/Clerk bridges), presentational components, styling via Tailwind v4. See `docs/doctrine/frontend-doctrine.md`.>

## 5. Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Handling |
|-------|-------|----------|
| <Error type> | <Trigger> | <Response> |

---

## 6. Testing Strategy

| Layer | Test Focus | Command |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Domain | Pure invariants, Result composition | `pnpm app:test test/unit/domain/<feature>` |
| Backend (Convex) | Auth guards, schema, queries/mutations via `convex-test` | `pnpm app:test test/integration/convex/<feature>` |
| Frontend | Components with Testing Library, hook wiring | `pnpm app:test test/unit/components/<feature>` |
| E2E | Full flow with Playwright + Clerk testing tokens | `pnpm app:test:e2e <feature>` |

---

## 7. Failure Modes (FMEA)

| # | Failure Mode | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|--------------|----------|------------|
| 1 | <What can go wrong> | Critical/High/Medium/Low | <Prevention> |

---

## 8. Prompt Execution Strategy

<!--
PROTOCOL: This section follows docs/protocol/sdd/execution-format.md
COMPLETENESS: Verify against docs/protocol/sdd/_SPEC-STANDARD.md §5 invariants
-->

### Phase 1: <Phase Name>

#### Step 1.1: <Step Title>

<Self-contained prompt for Claude Code CLI>

Include:
- Exact file paths
- Import patterns
- Code to create/modify
- Recovery guidance ("If X fails, do Y")

Tools to use: <Write/Edit/Bash>
Tools to NOT use: <Edit if file doesn't exist>

##### Verify

- `pnpm app:compile`
- `<additional verification>`

##### Timeout

120000

#### Step 1.2: <Step Title>

...

#### Gate

- `pnpm app:compile`
- `pnpm test:unit:ci`

### Phase 2: <Phase Name>

...

### Phase N: Doctrine Review

<!--
This phase is MANDATORY. It ensures learnings from implementation
feed back into the doctrine system (living documentation).
-->

#### Step N.1: Review Implementation Against Doctrines

Review all code written in this spec against the doctrines that were loaded.

Check the doctrine manifest at `docs/doctrine/doctrine-manifest.yaml` to identify which doctrines applied to this spec based on trigger keywords.

For each relevant doctrine, answer these questions:

1. **Compliance**: Did we follow all MUST/MUST NOT rules?
   - If NO: Document the violation and why it was necessary

2. **New Patterns**: Did we discover patterns that should become doctrine?
   - If YES: Document the pattern with rationale

3. **Outdated Rules**: Did we find doctrine that is wrong or outdated?
   - If YES: Document what's wrong and the correction

4. **Missing Coverage**: Did we encounter scenarios doctrine doesn't address?
   - If YES: Document the gap

If ANY amendments are needed, create:
`docs/tasks/ongoing/<feature>/doctrine-amendments.md`

Format for amendments file:
```markdown
# Doctrine Amendments: <Feature>

## Compliance Violations
- [doctrine]: [rule violated] - [justification]

## New Patterns to Add
- [doctrine]: [pattern] - [rationale]

## Outdated Rules to Update
- [doctrine]: [current rule] → [proposed update]

## Missing Coverage
- [doctrine]: [scenario not covered]
```

If no amendments needed, this step passes automatically.

##### Verify

- `test -f docs/tasks/ongoing/<feature>/doctrine-amendments.md && echo "Amendments documented" || echo "No amendments needed"`

#### Step N.2: Commit Doctrine Amendments (if any)

If `doctrine-amendments.md` exists, create a follow-up task to review and merge amendments into doctrines.

Add to `docs/tasks/ongoing/doctrine-updates/` if it doesn't exist:
```bash
mkdir -p docs/tasks/ongoing/doctrine-updates
```

Move amendments for human review:
```bash
cp docs/tasks/ongoing/<feature>/doctrine-amendments.md \
   docs/tasks/ongoing/doctrine-updates/<feature>-amendments.md
```

##### Verify

- `ls docs/tasks/ongoing/doctrine-updates/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No doctrine updates pending"`

## 9. Operational Queries

### Status Check

```sql
-- Check <entity> state
SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...;
```

### Invariant Audit

```sql
-- Verify <invariant> (expected: 0 rows)
SELECT ... WHERE <violation condition>;
```
